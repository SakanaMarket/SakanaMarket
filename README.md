Heyo!

I'm Matt and I'm a small time indie game dev.

Mostly, I make games for students to get interested in the world of cybersecurity, but I also like making retro games and making artsy things.

It's a never-ending struggle to learn new things when it comes to development, but it's fun and I like what I do.
